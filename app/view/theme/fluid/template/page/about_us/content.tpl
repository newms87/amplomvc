		One of my true passions is people. I have always felt a calling to serve. After graduating with a Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, I have worked as a licensed addictions and mental health therapist serving rural areas of Montana. I believe in the greater health of people and in providing quality services where needed.<br />
		<br />
		As we raise our three beautiful children, we saw a need in quality house hold and personal care products. I found myself disappointed when reading lables with harmful synthetic chemicals such as: sulfates, toxins, parabens, fragrance, petrolatum, etc…<br />
		<br />
		I just happened to be married to a brilliant Chemical Engineer :) and, together, we have formulated an organic product line safe for babies and tough enough for even the roughest cowboys.<br />
		<br />
		We adore our children and strive to choose health conscious foods and products. What goes into our bodies is equally as important as what we put on our skin. Our skin is our largest organ and it is vital to care for it intentionally.<br />
		<br />
		We have poured our hearts and knowledge into Buckaroo Organics™ to be able to share a unique line of organic products you can trust.<br />
		<br />
		On a daily basis, we are reminded of God’s greatness and thankful for the relationships in our life.<br />
		<br />
		From our house to yours,<br />
		Lindsay and Brad</div>
